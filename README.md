# GoDraw

This is an experimental [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project. The goal is to write a mobile-first [ANSI Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art) drawing application in the mold of [TheDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw), [ACiDDraw](http://www.acid.org/apps/apps.html), and [PabloDraw](http://picoe.ca/products/pablodraw/).

This is an excuse for me to learn Flutter and Dart, so there's not much going on here other than a million refactors an hour and probably a lot of really dumb Dart code.

Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a high-level list of changes made so far.
